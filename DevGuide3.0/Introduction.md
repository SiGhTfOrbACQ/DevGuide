Welcome to the totally re-written OWASP Guide 3.0! The OWASP Guide has been re-written to be:
Shorter
* More applicable
* More functional
The previous Guide contained information on how to review, attack and protect code. That is no longer necessary now that the Code Review Guide and Penetration Testing Guides have been completed. This version of the Guide concentrates upon writing solid, safe and secure code. By reducing the length of the Guide to no more than 150 pages, we hope that more architects, designers, business analysts, software engineers and developers will be able to digest the new version, thus creating safe and more secure applications. There will never be a one page version of this book. 
Architects and designers should digest the first section and use the remaining sections like an encyclopedia or dictionary – looking up controls as necessary. Software engineers should read the entire Guide. The reasoning behind choosing certain controls is in the first section, and the controls themselves in the remaining sections.
Those who set policy are recommended to read as much as they can – only by knowledge of what can go wrong can organizations set policy to prevent the acquisition or development of insecure software. 
It is far harder to write solid code than to destroy it. Necessarily, this book contains a great deal of information. Not every application will require every control, and thus it is necessary to 
About the Open Web Application Security Project

## Security Architecture
Security architecture is not separate to the normal architecture of an application – it is an innate aspect of the architecture of even the simplest systems. Security architecture should be stable for at least two-three years in the average application. 
## Fundamentals
The fundamentals of application security have not changed in over 30 years. However, there was an interregnum where these details were simply forgotten and not taught and certainly not implemented. Indeed, it is rare to find computer science and software engineering degrees with even a rudimentary security course. Thankfully, this is beginning to change. However, it will take a very long time
